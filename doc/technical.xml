        This website will run with PHP (really?) Version 5.3. I intend to build 
        the app using the recent version of ZendFramework 2 which is (as far as 
        I recall from memory) zf2beta3. But other Ideas are welcome!

        Registration, Login, Modification and Display of the data will be 
        registered as Modules and the redirect for the "shortlink" will be 
        exported to an .htaccess-file on every change on the short-name or the 
        website of a Usergroup 
    </para><para>
        The actual redirect will then be provided via mod_rewrite

        As Backend we will be using either a MySQL or a PostgreSQL Database, 
        depending on the hosting-provider.
